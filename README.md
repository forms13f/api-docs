## App Description

This API provides access to indexed data from the EDGAR database, specifically focusing on Form 13F filings.

Form 13F is a quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with over $100 million in assets under management. These filings are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide a detailed list of all equity securities under the manager's control. Each filer is identified by a Central Index Key (CIK), and each form is identified by a combination of the CIK and an accession number. Forms may also have amendments, which are filed to correct or update information.

This project offers an API to access this data using either REST or a Python SDK. You can find the Python SDK on [GitHub](https://github.com/forms13f/python-sdk). Additionally, there are examples available in Jupyter Notebooks, which can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/forms13f/python-sdk).
